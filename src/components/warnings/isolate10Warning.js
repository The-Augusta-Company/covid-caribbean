          clinic unless your symptoms worsen. If you do need to visit an
          emergency department, family doctor, or walk-in clinic, please call
          ahead and tell them your symptoms, any international travel within 14
          days, and whether you have had close contact with a suspected or
          confirmed case of COVID-19.
