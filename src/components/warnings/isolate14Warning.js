        Since you don't have symptoms, you do not need testing for COVID-19 at
        this time. However, there’s a chance you could get sick since it’s less
        than 14 days since your exposure. You should self-monitor for any
        symptoms (fever, cough, sneezing, sore throat, or difficulty breathing).
        If you begin to develop these, you should take this self-assessment
        again.
